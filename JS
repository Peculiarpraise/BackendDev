#JavaScript Display Possibilities. JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML or innerText.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

#DOCSTRING means a multiline comment

#JavaScript statements are composed of Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}. 
The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. That is a function

#JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

#The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals, while Variable values are called Variables.

#Javascript comments
Single-line comments start with //.
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

#Variables are Containers for Storing Data. JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
  Automatically
  Using var
  Using let
  Using const

#JavaScript Identifiers
These unique names that variables have are called identifiers.Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
Rules:
  Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  Names must begin with a letter.
  Names can also begin with $ and _
  Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
  Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

#In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
